## Setup

- Get the latest APK [here](https://github.com/bpavuk/touche/releases/latest)
- Get the latest driver [here](https://github.com/bpavuk/touche-driver) (at the moment, only Linux is supported)
- Run the driver

While the driver is running, you can connect your phone or tablet anytime and you'll see the surface
pop up. Touch, scribble, write, swipe, and don't forget to report any issues that may arise
in the [Issues](https://github.com/bpavuk/touche/issues) tab. Oh, and, don't scratch out your phone
in the process, though I doubt your fingers and stylus can reach

Boom! It's as simple as that. No ads, no subscriptions, ~~no fuckery~~ TODO: make it stable
